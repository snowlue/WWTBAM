    - ‚ÇΩ5,000 at question 5 and ‚ÇΩ100,000 at question 10 are guaranteed amounts ‚Äî if you pass these milestones, you will receive the sum even if you lose.
    - Your main goal is to reach ‚ÇΩ3,000,000.
- Use up to three lifelines by clicking on them with your mouse or pressing from 1 to 7 on your keyboard:
    - 50:50 removes two incorrect answers to make it easier
    - "Ask the Audience" shows the audience answer statistics to help you choose the correct answer
    - "Double Dip" allows you to answer again if your first answer is wrong
    - "Switch the Question" swaps the current question with another of the same difficulty
    - "Revival" lets you use one of the lifelines you have already used
    - "Immunity" protects you from a wrong answer ‚Äî if you make a mistake, you will leave the game with the sum you have already earned
    - "Freeze the Timer" stops the timer until you answer the question
- You can take the money and leave the game by clicking on the home icon or pressing 8 on your keyboard.
