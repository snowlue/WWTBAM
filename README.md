## How to start:

1. Open your terminal in repo's folder
2. Type next commands:
    ```batch
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python main.py
    ```
    OR (only for Windows & if you don't have Python)
    ```batch
    cd bin
    main.exe
    ```
3. Have a fun ^_^

⠀(4.) In addition the folder «bin» is self-contained and you can use it on any drive on Windows even if you don't have Python.

## Rulebook:

- Answer the questions by mouse pressing on A-, B-, C-, D-answer or by keyboard pressing on Q, W, A, S:
    - 5 000₽ on the 5th question and 100 000₽ on the 10th question are guaranteed, even if you lose the game, you'll get these sums
    - Your main goal — get the 3 000 000₽ top prize.
- Use lifelines by mouse pressing on lifelines at the money tree or by keyboard pressing on 1, 2, 3, 4:
    - Changer changes the question to another
    - 50:50 removes two incorrect answers to make the question easier
    - ×2 gives you a second chance to answer the question — if your answer is incorrect you can answer one more time. 
- You can get your current prize and leave the game by pressing home icon at the money tree.
- You can watch the table of records and set new records when you play the game (also supports erasing).
